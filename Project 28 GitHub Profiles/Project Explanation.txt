This is one of my favorite projects I have made for now, because I have learned to much from it, As an appreviation we made a Github Profiles project, Let's explain it.

When you open the web page you will find a search place, you have to enter any Github Profile name you want to search for it, then press Enter.

If the entered name is right, the Github Profile will appear in front of you with some information about it as follows: 
    1) User Name => It wiil appear at the top of the card.

    2) User Avatar => The image of that user in the Github Profile.

    3)  User Bio => Here if the user has a bio you will see it, or you will see this if he hasn't(This user donot have a bio till now!!).

    4) 3 Numbers as info for this user ==> Followers, Following, Repos.

    5) The Latest 10 Projects for this user ==> The projects will appear with their names, and you click on the name to go to the project on Github.

Now, It's your time bro to try the project and enter the user that you want to know more about his Github Profile.

Don't forget bro, It is important for me to hear your opinion about this project.
