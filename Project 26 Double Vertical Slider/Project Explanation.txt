In this project we made a nice Vertical Slider, so Let's explain it.

When you open the web page you will find it seperated into 2 parts (left with the text to explain, and the right with the image).

Also you will find a 2 Arrows (one to up and the other to down).

When you press on each one of them you will get a nice sliding effect between the right and left parts (to match the text in left with image in right).

Now it's your time bro, just open the browser and try the project and press many times on the 2 Arrows to see the nice sliding effect.

Don't forget bro, Your opinion is so important for me.
