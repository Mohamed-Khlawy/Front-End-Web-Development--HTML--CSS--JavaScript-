In this simple project we did the idea of Taost Notificaitons (that appear in a side of the page), Let's explain it.

When you open the web page you will find a button in the middle of the web page (Show Notification) and when you press on it a notificaiton will appear in the bottom right of the web page.

Each time you press on it, a new notification will appear in the bottom right and if you press many times after each other new messages will appear on the top of each other.

Don't worry each message take a 3 seconds and then it disappears automatically.

Each message will have a random text and random color from the following:
    1) Message Texts:
        1.1) Message One.
        1.2) Message Two.
        1.3) Message Three.
        1.4) Message Four.

    2) Message Colors: 
        1.1) Purble (Default Message).
        1.2) Green (Success Message).
        1.3) Red (Error Message).

You can change this with any values you want, and I know that this is a simple project, but we can use this idea when we want to show any notifications to the user.

Now it's your time bro, try the project and press on the middle button many times to see the notificaitons.

Don't forget bro, I will be very happy to hear your opinion about the project.
