In this simple project we did the idea of an Imgae Carousel, so let's explain it.

When you open the web page, you will find in the middle of the page the Imgae Carousel (a square to display the images and they are change automatically each 2 seconds).

There is also 2 Buttons at the bottom of the Carousel square as following:
    1) Previous Imgae ==> this will swap for the Previous Image of the current one.
    2) Next Imgae ==> this will swap for the Next Image of the current one.

Don't worry bro, if you press on the buttons the images won't display with a flicker effect, we handled this thing already.

Not it's your time to try the project and see the images with automatically swapping or swapping by the buttons.

Don't forget bro, I care to hear your opinion about this project.
