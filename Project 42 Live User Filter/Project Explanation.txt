In this project we made the idea of the Live User Filter using (randomuser.me API ==> https://randomuser.me/), so let's explain it.

When you open the web page you will find the Filter place and you will find it Loading the data from the API, after a few seconds the data will appear in front of you and each user has data as following:
    1) User Picture.
    2) User Name (First and Last).
    3) User City and User Country (beside of each other but separated by comma).

You can also search for a specific user at the Search place at the top of the Filter place and the results will be filtered by using your search.

Now it's your time bro to test the projcet with yourself on your browser.

Don't forget bro, I will be happy to hear your opinion about the project.
