In this simple project we did a small and nice Hoverboard, so let's explain it.

Shortly, when you open the web page you will find some squares in the middle of the page with Black as the Background-Color, and when you start to Hover over these squares there colors will change with some random colors, and after you Unhover from the squares, each square will back to the Black Color after 2 seconds.

I know that this is a simple project, but it's a starting idea for a bigger Drawing Projects and some of these ideas.

Now it's your time bro to test the prjoect to get a better understanding for its' idea.

Don't forget bro, I am waiting your opinion about the project.
