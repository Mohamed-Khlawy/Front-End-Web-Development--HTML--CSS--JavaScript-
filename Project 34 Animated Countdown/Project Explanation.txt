In this project we made a nice Animated Countdown, so Let's explain it.

When you open or reload the web page, you will see in the middle of the page a Countdown with a nice Animation (Shortly, the countdown will start with 3, then number 3 goes down in a nice rotation effect, then number 2 comes from the opposite side with the reverse rotation, and so on until we reach to 0).

When the countdown finished by showing 0 as the last number in the countdown, the whole countdown will disappear and a Final Message will appear instead of the Countdown.

the Final Message has Button to Replay the cooler Animated Countdown again, so if you press it the Animation will start again (press Replay Button = Reload the Web Page).

Now it's your time bro to see the project and replay it many times to see it clearly and understand its mechanism.

Don't forget bro, I want to hear your fantastic opinion about this project.
