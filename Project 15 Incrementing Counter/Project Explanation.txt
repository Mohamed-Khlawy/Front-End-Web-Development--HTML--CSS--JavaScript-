In this project we did the Incrementing Counter for anything you want, Let's explain it.

In our web page we choose to view 3 Incrementing Counters (Twitter Followers, YouTube Subscribers, Facebook Fans and Don't worry bro you can choose any counter and it will be in the same way for these).

When you reload the Web Page these 3 counters will start to be incremented from (Zero) until it reaches to the number you will add in the (data-target Attribute in index.html file and then will be incremented by the script.js file).

This is a nice idea to make it in your website in any Incrementing Counter you want to show it in the web page.

Now it's your time bro to try the project by running the index.html file in your browser.

Don't forget bro, I am waiting your opinion!!
