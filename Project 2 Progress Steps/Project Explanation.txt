In this project we did the idea of the Progress Steps or Progress Bar idea.

We have 4 main circles, each refer to a point in the progress bar (can be more easly with the same idea).

We also have a line between these circles to define in which circle we are now.

Finally we have 2 buttons (Prev and Next):
    1) Prev ==> to go to the previous circle, and this make the line go back one step per click on it.

    2) Next ==> to go to the next circle, and this make the line go forward one step per click on it.

It's really easy and funny project, Just open the index.html file and copy path to your browser and try the Progress Bar.
