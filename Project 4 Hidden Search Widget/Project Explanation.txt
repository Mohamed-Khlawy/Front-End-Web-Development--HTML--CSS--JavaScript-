In this simple project we did the idea of Hidden Search Widget, Let's explain it easily.

We have a Button in the middle of the web page, and when you click this button, the following happens:
    1) A hidden search widget appears on the left of the search button and get focused to write by default.

    2) The search button goes to the right of the search widget.

Finally, when you click again the search button, the inverse process happens and the button return to the middle of the web page and the search widget return hidden again.

Repeat this process many times to see the difference, and don't forget to tell me your opinion Bro.
