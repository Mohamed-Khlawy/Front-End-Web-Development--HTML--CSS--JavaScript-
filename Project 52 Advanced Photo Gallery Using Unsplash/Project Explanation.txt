In this project we made a new idea with the Unsplash API and we named it Photo Gallery, so let's explain it.

When you open the web page, you will find the gallery space at the middle of the page, but intially it won't have any photos.

You will find a Number Input, where you can put how many phoots you want to see in the gallery (Min photos is 2 and Max photos is 10).

After you enter the number of photos you want, press on the Button at the button in the gallery (GET PHOTOS).

Now the gallery will take a few seconds to GET the exast number of photos you entered previously, and the photos will start to appear in front of you in the gallery.

The page is responsive so, the following will happen based on your device:
    1) Laptop or PC ==> each row will have 3 photos as max number on each row.
    2) Ipad or Tablet ==> each row will have 2 photos as max number on each row.
    3) Mobile Phone ==> each row will have 1 photo as max number on each row.

Don't worry bro, rest of photos will be on the other rows so you may have scroll bars to see all photos.

Now it's your time bro, to test the project on your favorite device.

Don't forget bro, I will be happy to hear your opinion about the project.
