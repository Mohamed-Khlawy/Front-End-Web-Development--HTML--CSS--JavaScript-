In this project we made a Slider for the Background Images, Let's explain it.

When you open our web page, intially you will find an image in the background and a box in the middle of the web page with 2 arrows one on the left and the other on the right.

When you press any one of the arrows, the background image will change and the image in the box too to the same image.

It's an easy project specially if you have an image gallery or something like that.

Now, it's your time bro to try the project.

Don't forget bro I am waiting you fantastic opinion bro.
