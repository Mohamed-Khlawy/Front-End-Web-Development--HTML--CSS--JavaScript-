In this simple project we did the idea of Auto Text Effect, Let's explain it.

When you open the web page, you will find a text in the middle of the web page (We Love Programming!!).

This text will appear character by character until it reach to the end of it, then it will start from the beginning again.

The idea is that there is a Speed value at the bottom of the page, and it's intially will start with (1, as the default value), but there are 2 Cursors with it as following:
    1) Up Cursor ==> it increases the speed value of the text appearing by 1 with each click.

    2) Down Cursor ==> it decreases the speed value of the text appearing by 1 with each click.

I know that this a simple project, but we can use this effect with a Hero Banner of the web pages or any similar ideas.

Now, it's your time bro to test the project with yourself.

Don't forget I am waiting your opinion.
