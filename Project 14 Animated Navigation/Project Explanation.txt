In this simple project we made a nice Animated Navigation, Let's explain it easily.

In our web page specially in the middle of it we have the Navigation Bar, with 4 different links (Home, Works, About, Contact).

At the most Right of the Navigation Bar when the 4 Links are Visible, we have (X) Mark which will be displayed as default when you reload the web page with the Navigation Bar.

When you click on this (X) Mark the Navigation Bar and its links will start to disapper in a nice Animation and the (X) Mark will be converted after the Navigation Bar is disappered totally to the (=) Mark.

When you click the (=) Mark the Navigation Bar will back again to be visible and the mark will be converted to be (X) Mark again.

Now, It's your time to try the Project with the index.html file on your browser.

And Don't forget bro, I am waiting your fantastic opinion bro.
