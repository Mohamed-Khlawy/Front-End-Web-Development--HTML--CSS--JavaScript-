In this project we made a nice Pokemon App using Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/), so let's explain it.

When you open the web page, you will find 150 Pokemon Cards that explain some informations about each Pokemon as following:
    1) Pokemon Image
    2) Pokemon Id ==> this represents the specific id for this Pokemon within the API.
    3) Pokemon Name
    4) Pokemon Type ==> the type is written and the background color for the card will be slightly suitable for the Pokemon Type.

It's a simple and cooler project to learn how to fetch data from an specific API and display them in a convienent and easy way.

Now it's your time bro to open the project and see the Pokemon Cards with some of the informations for each one.

Don't forget bro, I am waiting your opinion about this project!
