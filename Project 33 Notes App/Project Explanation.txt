In this project we made Notes App with some nice features, so let's explain it.

When you open the web page, you can press on the button on the top right of the page to add a new note.

Then a new note will appear on the page and you can insert your words inside it.

After you finish typing, it you reload the page you will find that your note is still there.

Some features you can deal with:
    1) You can Edit your note by clicking on the button for Editing at the top right of each Note (Sure your edits will be saved as we explained above).

    2) You can Delete any note you don't want, by clicking on the Delete button also on the top right of each note (beside the Editing button).

Now it's your time bro to test the project and add as many notes as you want.

Don't forget I am waiting your opinion bro.
