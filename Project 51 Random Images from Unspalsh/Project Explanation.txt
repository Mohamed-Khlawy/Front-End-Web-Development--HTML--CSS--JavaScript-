First, this project is the upgraded version from the (Project 48 Random Image Feed ==> https://github.com/Mohamed-Khlawy/Front-End-Web-Development-HTML_CSS_JavaScript/tree/main/Project%2048%20Random%20Image%20Feed), you can go to it and read the Project Explanation of it, to understand why we have upgrade it in this project.

In this project we made the idea of Random Images from Unshplsh, so let's explain it easily.

When you open the page it will take a few seconds and then it will start to show in front of you 2 Images randomly from Unshplsh API.

These 2 images are existing at the 2 sides of the page (Left and Right sides), but you can see these 2 if you will run the project on an Ipad or Laptob or PC, but if you are runnig it on your phone it will show only 1 image.

For sure when you reload the page, you will find 2 new images not the previous 2 (Random Images bro!).

Now it's your time to test the project and see 2 different images with each reload.

Don't forget bro, I am waiting your opinion about this project.
