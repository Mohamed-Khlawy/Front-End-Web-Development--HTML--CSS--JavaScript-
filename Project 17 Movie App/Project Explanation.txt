In this project we made our First Movie App, Let's explain it.

When you open our web page you will get the first 20 popular movies in the API that we get the data from it (The Movie Database => https://www.themoviedb.org/ ) and don't worry it's always up to date with the new popular movies.

You can also search in our web page for a specific movie name and you will get the first 20 matching movies with the name you have entered.

Each movie part consists of the following:
    1) Movie Image.

    2) Movie Title.

    3) Movie Rating, with 3 color options based on the rating of the movie:
        3.1) Green ==> More than or equal to (8)
        3.2) Oragne ==> More than or equla to (5)
        3.3) Red ==> Lower than (5)

    4) Movie Overview ==> to see this you should hover over the Movie Image and it will appear from the bottom of the Movie part.


Now it's your time bro to try the Project.

Don't forget I am waiting your opinion bro.
