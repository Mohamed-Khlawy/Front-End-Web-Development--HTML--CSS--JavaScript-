In this project we made the idea of Split Landing Page, Let's explain it.

We divide the web page into two parts, each with it's image and when you hover to any side of them, this side gets larger and take 75% of the web page and the other side take the other 25% of the page.

This idea is applied either you hover to the right of left side.

Now, I will let you try it with yourself to understand it more easily.

Don't forget bro, I am waiting your opinion.
